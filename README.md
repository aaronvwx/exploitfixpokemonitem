# exploitfixpokemonitem
This a temporarily fix on a Cobblemon exploit using a pokemon and its held item feature. It is confirmed to be fixed in the new 1.4.0 update but for now in the 1.3.2 version, this will do fine.

IMPORTANT
Make sure the code line 26-27 on file common/src/main/kotlin/tech/sethi/aaronmusk/exploitfixpokemonitem/ExploitFixPokemonItem.kt is adjusted to your server's teleport commands. It uses a contain method, that means containing 'tp', will trigger '/tp', 'tpa', 'tpaccept', etc. The most basic ones are already in the code but if your server is using special ones, make sure to add them.
